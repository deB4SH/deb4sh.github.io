Hi all,
in my current role as platform engineer for the Hamburg Port Authority we need to keep the velocity high to provide a good service for our internal clients. As result most of our infrastructure is created through templates in any way. 

To get things up and running we developed a simple templater written in python with all required bindings towards jinja and kept expanding it. Naturally we expanded it without a direct scope and focus on reusability. Things needed to be done and it should work.
With growing struggle the need of a new templater arose. The idea of a new clean approach came up.

Let me present you: YART - yet another random templater

A *simple* but extensive templating tool for multiple needs. 
YART provides you a useful schema validation for your input data to keep it free of issues and also an option to create a dynamic template structure based on your input. 

Most specific for this tool may be the dynamic generation of folders based on your template. 
It allows you to *duplicate* a specific structure multiple times. 
Lets assume the following usecase.
You need to configure multiple clusters at once within an repository. 
Each cluster contains multiple services which require a value configuration.
To ease up the installation you split all dedicated values within a folder named after the service.
The resulting folder structure may look like the following listing.

```console
clusters
└── $name
    ├── externaldns
    └── mailhog
```

As configuration we are going to assume you want to template the following values onto your manifests.

```yaml
clusters:
  - name: happy-path-cluster
    defaults:
      storageClass: "storageclass-happy-path-cluster"
      serviceUri: "happy-path-cluster.corp.local"
    serviceCatalog:
      externalDns:
        powerdnsApiKey: "myAwesomeKey"
        domainFilter:
          - uri: "*.subdomain.corp.local"
          - uri: "*.sub.corp.local"
      mailhog:
        uri: "mailhog"
  - name: happier-path-cluster
    defaults:
      storageClass: "storageclass-cluster"
      serviceUri: "happier-path-cluster.corp.local"
    serviceCatalog:
      externalDns:
        powerdnsApiKey: "myAwesomeKey"
        domainFilter:
          - uri: "*.subdomain.corp.local"
          - uri: "*.sub.corp.local"
      mailhog:
        uri: "mailhog-awesomesauce"
```

Based on this configuration the result looks like the following listing

```console
clusters
├── happier-path-cluster
│   ├── externaldns
│   └── mailhog
└── happy-path-cluster
    ├── externaldns
    └── mailhog
```

The templated files could now easily picked up by your gitops tools and applied to the individual clusters.
This example is also available as code block wihtin the [YART Repository](https://github.com/deB4SH/YART/tree/main/src/test/resources/test_cases/05_complex_subschema).

A wider exaplaination of all features is also available within the [README.MD](https://github.com/deB4SH/YART/blob/main/README.md) within the repository. 

Through the implementation of YART we were able to solve multiple issues with our current template approach and installed a flexable and dynamic way to create our clusters and deployment configuration with ease.
